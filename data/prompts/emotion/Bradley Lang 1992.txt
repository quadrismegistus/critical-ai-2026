Vector model of emotion (Bradley, Greenwald, Petry, Lang, 1992).

Dimensions:
- Valence direction
- Arousal intensity

Category profiles:
- Positive High Arousal
- Positive Low Arousal
- Negative High Arousal
- Negative Low Arousal
- Neutral Low Arousal

Context:
- Arousal is always present; valence determines vector direction.

Examples:
1) "I feel thrilled and motivated." -> Positive High Arousal
2) "I feel mildly down but not agitated." -> Negative Low Arousal
3) "Nothing much is happening emotionally right now." -> Neutral Low Arousal
